<h1>The Music and Dance Scheme</h1>

<p>The Government's Music and Dance Scheme (MDS) supports the aims of Foundations for Excellence.
  The internationally recognised Scheme and its participating partners seek to identify, and assist,
  children and young people with exceptional talent, dedication and potential, regardless of their personal
  circumstances, to benefit from world-class specialist training as part of a broad and balanced education,
  which will enable them, if they choose, to proceed towards self-sustaining careers in music and dance.</p>

<p>The MDS provides targeted means-tested fee support and grants to designated centres of excellence for the education
  and vocational training of young musicians and dancers aged 8 to 19.  It represents the top of the pyramid for
  performing arts education and training and is the Governmentâ€™s main vehicle for funding the training needs of
  such children and young people.  Although small, the scheme, its beneficiaries, its participating organisations and
  its patrons have a huge impact on the performing arts world.</p>
